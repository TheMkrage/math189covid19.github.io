						<h3>Course Requirements and Evaluation:</h3>
						<p>
							&#9679; <b><i>Readings</i></b> <br>


	            To encourage the goal of reading active research in
                the field, some of the homeworks will have reading assignments. To ensure active reading we will ask for a short summary of key takeaways.  As long as your summary is reasonable, you will be given full credit.
                
                <br><br>


							&#9679; <b><i>Homework</i></b> <br>

                            The homework is due every week at 11:59 PST on Thursdays.
                            
							<br><br>
                            
                            Most, if not all, homework assignments will be in a Jupyter notebook. The starter code will be implemented in Python3 and students are recommended to continue in this format. <b>Note:</b> The homeworks have no been tested on many operating systems so if you run into an error feel free to contact the TA's for assistance.
            
							<br><br>
							<a href="http://www.numpy.org/">Numpy</a> and <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a>
							are two important python libraries to know for coding assignment for this
							course. You might also want to look at <a href="https://matplotlib.org/">Matplotlib</a> for
							generating plots.
							If you have never used these libraries before, make sure you
							check out the tutorials online before starting the first assignment.
							<br><br>
							
                            <b>Submitting homework:</b> We will be accessing your completed assignments through Github. Please share you completed assignments with <a href="https://github.com/math189COVID19/math189covid19.github.io"> math189COVID19</a> on Github. We recommend having a repository for this class that has been shared and add assignments to clearly labeled folders in that repository. <br><br>


							&#9679; <b><i>Final Project</i></b> <br>

							The final project is the largest component of the course.
							Each student will discover, explore, and attack a problem related to COVID-19. The detailed description and requirements
							for the final project can be found under the "Final Project" tab.
							<br><br>

							&#9679; <b><i>GitHub</i></b> <br>

							As we stated in the course overview, students are expected to
							become comfortable with Github. Hence, each student is required
							to create a Github account for coding assignment submission and
							final project submission. If you already have a Github account,
							that's perfect. If not, please create a personal Github account
							and go over the tutorials online.<br>
							<i>Note:</i> Please make sure to send the username of your Github
							account to TA for homework grading.
						</p>


						<h3>Classroom Policies:</h3>
						<p>
							&#9679; <b><i>Attendence</i></b> <br>

							Attendence for each lecture is mandatory and is expected of all
							class members. if you're going to miss a lecture, it is neccessary
							for you to inform the instructor as soon as possible. You are also
							responsible for obtaining notes from another class member.
							<br><br>



						<h3>Diabilities:</h3>
						<p>
							Students who need disability-related accommodations are
							encouraged to discuss this with the instructor as soon as
							possible.
